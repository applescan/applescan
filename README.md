- 👋 Hi, I’m @applescan
- 👀 I Specialize in Website Design & Development, Graphic Design and Visual Content Creation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Web Development


- I love to work on problem-solving together with the combination of design thinking and software development. 
- I hope with my skills and experience I can simplify the communication barriers by bridging the gap between designers and developers and creating an excellent product for end-users. 
- I want to do a design that considers the user’s goals and provides the simplest way to achieve those goals!
- At the moment I am getting my qualification in Introductory & Advanced Software Development, my reason for learning software development is so that I am able to understand designing from the software developer's perspective. Combined with my programme at UX Design Institue & Glasgow Caledonian University, I will be able to further the knowledge that I got from my software development qualification and apply it to human-centred design.
