- 🔭 I’m currently working in <a href="https://phoenix.tech/griffyn/" target="blank">Griffyn Robotech Private Limited</a>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development

- 💁 I love to work on problem-solving together with the combination of design thinking and software development. 

- ✔️ I hope with my skills and experience I can simplify the communication barriers by bridging the gap between designers and developers and creating an excellent product for end-users.

- 🎯 I want to do a design that considers the user’s goals and provides the simplest way to achieve those goals!

- 🎓  At the moment I just finished my qualification in Software Development with Auckland University of Technology, my reason for learning software development is so that I am able to understand designing from the software developer's perspective. Combined with my programme at UX Design Institue & Glasgow Caledonian University, I will be able to further the knowledge that I got from my software development qualification and apply it to human-centred design.
